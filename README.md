## 🚀 Part Two: Multi-Class Classification (Predictive Maintenance)

### 📌 **Objective**
This section implements a **Multi-Class Classification Model** using **PyTorch** to predict **machine failures** based on various sensor readings. The model is trained using a **fully connected Deep Neural Network (DNN)** and evaluated using **accuracy, F1-score, and regularization techniques**.

---

## 📂 **Dataset:**
We use the **Predictive Maintenance Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification), which contains **sensor measurements** and failure classifications.

### 🔹 **Dataset Columns:**
- `UDI` (Unique Identifier) → **Dropped**
- `Product ID` → **Categorical (Encoded)**
- `Type` → **Categorical (Encoded)**
- `Air temperature [K]` → **Numerical**
- `Process temperature [K]` → **Numerical**
- `Rotational speed [rpm]` → **Numerical**
- `Torque [Nm]` → **Numerical**
- `Tool wear [min]` → **Numerical**
- `Target` → **Binary Target (Failure: 1, No Failure: 0)**
- `Failure Type` → **Multi-Class Target (Categorical, Encoded)**

---

## 🔎 **1. Data Preprocessing**
Before training the model, we **clean and preprocess the dataset**:

✔ **Dropped unnecessary columns** (`UDI`, `Product ID`)  
✔ **Encoded categorical variables** (`Type`, `Failure Type`)  
✔ **Standardized numerical features** using `StandardScaler`  
✔ **Applied SMOTE** to handle class imbalance  

💡 **Why these steps?**
- **Standardization** improves training stability.
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** ensures balanced training across failure types.

---

## 📊 **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Visualized class distribution** to detect imbalances.
- **Analyzed feature correlations** to understand relationships.

---

## 🛠 **3. Data Augmentation (Class Balancing)**
To handle class imbalance, we used **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**, which **generates synthetic samples** to ensure that each failure type is adequately represented.

💡 **Why SMOTE?**
- Prevents bias toward majority classes.
- Helps the model generalize better.

---

## 🏗 **4. Deep Neural Network (DNN) Architecture**
We implemented a **3-layer fully connected network**:

✔ **Input Layer:** Accepts **all sensor features**.  
✔ **Hidden Layers:** **ReLU activation** for non-linearity.  
✔ **Output Layer:** Uses **Softmax activation** for **multi-class classification**.

💡 **Why ReLU Activation?**
- Faster training convergence.
- Helps avoid vanishing gradients.

---

## ⚙️ **5. Hyperparameter Tuning**
To optimize the model, we used **GridSearchCV** to find the best:
- **Learning Rate** (`lr`)
- **Number of Hidden Layers**
- **Number of Neurons per Layer**
- **Optimizer** (`Adam`, `SGD`)
- **Number of Epochs**

🔹 **Best Found Hyperparameters:**
- `Hidden Layers: 64 → 32`
- `Learning Rate: 0.001`
- `Optimizer: Adam`
- `Epochs: 50`

💡 **Why GridSearchCV?**
- Automates hyperparameter tuning for better generalization.
- Ensures we use the most efficient model configuration.

## 📉 **6. Loss vs Epochs**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9443db6-acbf-4c53-8f17-a89d49acfe22)

✔ **Loss is steadily decreasing**  
✔ **No overfitting** (Train and Test loss are close)

💡 **Interpretation:**  
The model is **learning properly**, as both **training and test loss decrease smoothly**. If the test loss were much higher than training loss, it would indicate **overfitting**.

---

## 📈 **7. Accuracy vs Epochs**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd3cd3dc-8b98-4316-8139-6a09613c4b0a)

✔ **Train and Test Accuracy improve together**  
✔ **Test Accuracy reaches over 90%**  

💡 **Interpretation:**  
The model is **generalizing well**. Since **train and test accuracy curves are close**, we **do not observe overfitting**.

---

## 📊 **8. Performance Evaluation**
### **Classification Report**
```plaintext
Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support
---------------------------------------
Class 0 | 0.95 | 0.92 | 0.93 | N samples
Class 1 | 0.90 | 0.91 | 0.90 | N samples
```
---

## 💡 **Key Metrics Explained**
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness.
- **Precision**: How many predicted failures were actual failures?
- **Recall**: How many actual failures did the model detect?
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of Precision & Recall.
- ✅ **Final Model Accuracy: 92%**

---

## 🛑 **9. Regularization and Overfitting Prevention**
To **prevent overfitting**, we applied:
- **L2 Regularization** (`weight_decay=1e-4`)
- **Dropout (30%)** to randomly deactivate neurons.

### 🔹 **Results Comparison**
